# 🚴 Bike Sales Visualization Project

## 📜 Project Overview

This project is a detailed **Data Visualization exercise** using a bike sales dataset. The primary goal was to practice and demonstrate proficiency in creating various types of charts—specifically **Line Charts**, **Bar Charts**, and **Pie Charts**—to analyze key business metrics such as revenue, profit, and sales distribution across different dimensions.

## 💾 Data Source

The analysis is based on a comprehensive bike sales dataset, which includes transactional details for various bike products, accessories, and clothing across multiple global regions.

## 📊 Visualizations and Analysis

The project includes three main types of visualizations, each designed to answer specific business questions.

### 1. Line Chart: Annual Revenue and Profit Trend

**Question:** How have the company's annual profit and revenue changed over time?

* **Data Used:** Annual Revenue and Profit from **2017 to 2021**.
* **Visualization Focus:** A **Line Chart** to clearly display the trend and growth rate of both metrics simultaneously.
* **Key Finding:** There is a consistent and strong **upward trend** in both Annual Revenue and Annual Profit, indicating healthy business growth year-over-year from 2017 to 2021.

### 2. Bar Chart: Product Revenue by Country

**Question:** What are the top-performing product categories and countries in terms of revenue?

* **Data Used:** Revenue aggregated by **Country** and **Product Category** (Bikes, Accessories, Clothing).
* **Visualization Focus:** A **Clustered Bar Chart** to compare revenue contributions side-by-side across countries and product types.
* **Key Finding:**
    * The **Bikes** product category is the dominant revenue driver across all countries.
    * The **United States** and **Australia** are the top-performing countries by total revenue.
    * **Accessories** and **Clothing** contribute a smaller, but still significant, portion of the total revenue.

### 3. Pie Chart: Revenue Distribution by Age Group

**Question:** Which age groups contribute the most to the total revenue?

* **Data Used:** Total revenue distributed among the four primary **Age Groups**: Adults (35-64), Young Adults (25-34), Youth (<25), and Seniors (64+).
* **Visualization Focus:** A **Pie Chart** to illustrate the proportion of total revenue contributed by each segment.
* **Key Finding:** The largest share of the total revenue comes from the **Adults (35-64)** and **Young Adults (25-34)** groups, highlighting the importance of targeting customers in these demographics. The **Seniors (64+)** group represents the smallest segment of the total revenue.
